This location awareness then leads to discontinuities at the stitching boundaries. Therefore we'll use 'valid' padding instead of 'same' padding.\n",

    "Here we first tile the input image and feed the tiles to the network to generate our predictions. Then the tiles are cropped and stitched to form the final embeddings. In the lecture you learned that U-Nets are shift equivariant only for shifts that are multiples of $f^l$, since our network does pooling with window size and stride $2$ and has $4$ pooling layers $f^l=2^4=16$. When stitching output crops of this U-Net whose spatial dimensions are not multiples of $16$ you might observe discontinuities at the stitching boundaries that lead to false splits. \n",
